## üèóÔ∏è Advanced Frontend Architecture

### Combined UI Framework Implementation

The frontend implements a sophisticated theming system that merges Chakra UI and Material UI:

```typescript
// Unified theme providers prevent conflicts
<ChakraProvider theme={ezunderChakraTheme}>
  <ThemeProvider theme={ezunderMuiTheme}>
    <CssBaseline />
    {/* Application components can use both UI libraries seamlessly */}
  </ThemeProvider>
</ChakraProvider>
```

**Key Features:**
- Synchronized color palettes and typography
- Consistent spacing and breakpoints
- CSS-in-JS conflict prevention
- Design system scalability

### State Management Architecture

```typescript
// React Query for server state
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: 3,
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,
    },
  },
});

// Context providers for global state
<AuthProvider>
  <AIProvider>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* Application */}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </AIProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

## üîí Enterprise-Grade Security

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration/Login**: Secure password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
2. **Token Generation**: JWT with RS256 algorithm and secure claims
3. **Cookie Management**: HTTP-only, secure, SameSite cookies
4. **Refresh Strategy**: Automatic token rotation with sliding expiration

### Security Headers (Helmet.js)

```typescript
helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
      // ... comprehensive CSP configuration
    },
  },
  crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: false,
})
```

### Rate Limiting Strategy

- Global: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Authentication: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- AI endpoints: Custom limits based on token usage
- Graceful degradation with informative error messages

## ü§ñ AI Integration Architecture

### Vertex AI Gemini Implementation

```typescript
// Advanced AI service configuration
const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-001',
  generationConfig: {
    maxOutputTokens: 8192,
    temperature: 0.7,
    topP: 0.8,
    topK: 40,
  },
  safetySettings: [
    // Comprehensive safety configuration
  ],
});
```

## üìä Database Design Excellence

### Schema Architecture

```sql
-- Users with comprehensive profile management
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  -- ... additional fields with proper constraints
);

-- Projects for content organization
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  -- ... project management fields
);

-- Documents with versioning and metadata
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  -- ... document management with full-text search
);

-- AI usage tracking for analytics
CREATE TABLE ai_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
